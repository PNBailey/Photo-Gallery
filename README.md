Photo Gallery

Photo gallery application that allows users to like and comment on my photos. Authentication is enabled with my Google Firebase back end. Once a user is logged in, they can like an image which will save the image in a list of liked images. Users can view images in full view mode and can see comments left by other users. Using CSS grid has enabled me to incorporate this mosaic style UI whilst ensuring the application is responsive.
